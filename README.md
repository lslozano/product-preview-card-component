## My process

1.- First step was to start with a mental model on how I would structure the DOM.
2.- Second step was to reset CSS and create the DOM structure.
3.- From there, I started working with the styles, applying general styles, then colors and typography and finally granular ones.
4.- The application of the styles was done in a general manner. When that was finished, I moved into components.
5.- Lastly, I polished the project, did some needed refactors, added variables and props.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool
- This project was done without the Figma reference file

### What I learned

1.- Use of CSS variables
2.- Transition effects
3.- Improve on my workflow
4.- Work with responsive images and the picture tag

### Continued development

- If this was a more complex project, I would suggest to add validation through prop types.
- Review micro layouts.
